## Description

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science, consisting of nodes where each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. In C programming, we can represent binary trees using structures.

### Node Structure:
```c
struct Node {
    int data;           // Holds data for the node
    struct Node* left;  // Pointer to the left child
    struct Node* right; // Pointer to the right child
};
```

### Operations Supported:
1. **Insertion:** Add new nodes to the binary tree according to a specified rule, such as comparing values.

2. **Traversal:** Traverse through the binary tree in different orders:
   - Inorder: Left, Root, Right
   - Preorder: Root, Left, Right
   - Postorder: Left, Right, Root

3. **Deletion:** Remove nodes from the tree while maintaining its structure.

### Common Applications:
Binary trees are used in various applications, including:
- Representing hierarchical structures like file systems.
- Implementing searching and sorting algorithms, such as Binary Search Trees (BST).
- Parsing and evaluating mathematical expressions.

### Implementation Notes:
Implementing binary trees in C involves managing memory allocation, implementing traversal algorithms, and ensuring the integrity of the tree structure.
